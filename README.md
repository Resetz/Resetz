Awards
- USACO Platinum
- AIME Qualifier
- Experience in C++, Python, Java, x86-64, C#, Typescript, Swift.
- Previous work in:
    - Dynamic systems in MATLAB | Designed frameworks for modelling DNA methylation using mean field approximation. Concluded parameter intervals where approximate models of 20x more CpG sites were accurate.
    - Kernal optimiazaition of K-means | Revised the K-means algorithm using Kernel Fusion (KF). Eliminates unecessary data movement added by the Intel GEMM matrix routines by merging related matrix operations at assembly level.
- Projects:
    - Linear equation solver in x86 assembly: Developed from scratch. Managed registers, memory, and stack pointer flow. Naive row reduction written in x86 assembly interfaced with C. Debugged in Visual Studio 2019.
    - Multithreaded Tic-Tac-Toe in Java: Developed a GUI version of Tic-Tac-Toe in Java using threads. Abstracted server, client, and game threads that communicated with Java's built-in data streams. Managed asynchronous variables and threads. 
- Interests: Algorithms and optimization, Distributed systems, Networks, Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI)
